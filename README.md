# SFML-BattleShips
A C++ based BattleShips game created with the SFML game engine

This project was created as a university course project.
Feel free to read, edit, share, and leech anything from it, it's totally up for you to do anything you wish really.

PS: The project was unfinished, not well documented, and has several bugs left unfixed. It's not the most efficient nor well written code you'll ever see, it's actually my first MAJOR project as a programmer so go easy on me.

Why do you wish to use this project?
Unlike the rest of the projects released online, which are CMD propmpt based. This one is more complex and GUI based with mouse point-to-interact feature, implemented sound/music system and a whole functioning menu.

Enjoy :)
